# CSR-Racing-2
Project feedback, bug reports and comments are welcomed over at our discord server: https://discord.gg/XVZbNan <br>

**Notes:**<br>
**Important updates**
1. The project has undergone 1 year and 6 months of updates. In order to maintain this huge project, I paid a lot of time and energy. In order to maintain my motivation for subsequent updates, after a careful decision, I changed to a partial payment model from the next version. <br>

2. What is the partial payment model? <br>
Players can freely use all the cars in the current version. The new version update will be released on github in the form of a compressed package, but it is encrypted. Players can use the compressed password after payment.<br>

3. After the new version is released, the old version of the car will cancel the encryption function and archive it in the Cars folder, which players can use at will. <br>

4. Charges are based on the number of updates of the major version. Please select the corresponding file to pay according to your actual needs. All files include all cars in the current new version. For version differences, please check the "Version Difference" document description in the folder; <br>

5. When the player pays, Please leave your email, I will reply to the email in time to inform the password, or contact me at discord (wear87#4510). <br>

In order to make it easier for players to find cars, and the original catalog was bloated, I took the time to optimize the catalog. The cars in the cars folder were changed from the activity classification to the brand classification, so that the classification is clearer in structure.<br>

① Donations are welcome!<br>
Keeping a project this big running smoothly really need lots of effort and we put lots of our free times into it.<br>
We will keep on releasing new cars as soon as the game update is rolled out and keep them nice and clean directly extract from the game codes **for free**.<br>
But we could need your help! Donate to this project and help us! Buy us a cup of coffee or a muffin will make our days!<br>
This is 100% optional and you can still use our project for free as usual. <br>
Join our discord channel and ask all about it in the project chatting room!<br>
Thanks for your support and happy racing!<br>
